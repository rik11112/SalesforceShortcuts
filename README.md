# SalesforceShortcuts
A simple extension with working salesforce shortcuts. I noticed the shortcuts in salesforce don't always work, so I wrote this quick extension to get the most important ones working all the time. I might add more shortcuts in the future.

## How to install
To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Click on the following link to download the extension ZIP file:

3. Enable the "Developer mode" toggle switch located at the top right corner of the Extensions page.

4. Drag and drop the extension ZIP file onto the Extensions page.

5. The SalesforceShortcuts extension should now be installed and ready to use.
